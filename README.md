Outcome of the coding dojo. Open a file explorer, double click on `src/cli.sln`. In Visual Studio press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to start a build. After that type `Ctrl+Q` and type `Test explorer`, which brings up the test explorer view 
allowing you to run the tests.

The solution builds also via Github Actions -> checkout the `Actions` tab.
